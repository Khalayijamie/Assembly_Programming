# Assembly Programming Course

Welcome to the **Assembly Programming Course**! This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of assembly language using the **NASM assembler**. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of how low-level programming works, and you will be able to write, debug, and optimize assembly programs.

---

## Course Overview

This course is designed to teach you assembly language programming from the ground up. Over 13 weeks, we will cover topics such as:
- CPU architecture and registers
- Data representation and memory manipulation
- Control flow (loops, conditionals, and jumps)
- Functions and the call stack
- System calls and file handling
- Debugging and optimization

Each week will consist of a theoretical lecture and a practical session where you will write assembly programs.

## Setup Instructions

Before you begin, you need to install NASM and set up your development environment.

### Step 1: Install NASM

- **Windows**: Follow the [Windows Setup Guide](setup/windows-setup.md).
- **Linux**: Follow the [Linux Setup Guide](setup/linux-setup.md).


### Step 2: Install GDB (Optional but recommended)

For debugging your assembly code, you can use the GNU Debugger (GDB). Follow the instructions in [debugging.md](setup/debugging.md) to set up GDB.

### Step 3: Test Your Setup

Once NASM is installed, test your environment by compiling and running the sample `Hello, World!` program in [week01_intro](lectures/week01_intro/hello_world.asm). The instructions for compiling and running are provided in that folder.

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you should be able to:
1. Understand how a CPU executes low-level instructions.
2. Write assembly programs that perform arithmetic, control flow, and file operations.
3. Work with CPU registers, memory, and the stack.
4. Debug and optimize assembly code.
5. Integrate assembly code with higher-level languages (e.g., C).
